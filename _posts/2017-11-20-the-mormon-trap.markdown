Perhaps one will labor to find a group that was more wrongly treated than the Native Americans during the founding of 
America. In that endeavor, one is likely to find one's self exerting  without apparent fruit. Most stories that Americans 
know that involve such a level of genocide are relegated to foreign maniac dictators. However, the story of America is 
riddled with people who are regarded as heroes who did deeds that were just as bloody and malevolent. The story of the 
founding of the Mormon church is one that reveals how even burgeoning religions could engage in bloodshed to control a land 
that they had no business controlling. (this is not unique to Mormonism. 
Governments would later do the same thing)

Nonetheless, history records the Black Hawk Wars--but usually it does not list 
the causes. It often records some of the illustrious personages who fought within the war: Abraham Lincoln, Winfield Scott, 
Zachary Taylor and Jefferson Davis.  Likewise, we understand that it involved broken promises and generally displeased 
Indians led by Black Hawk. What we are not told is how the Mormons are involved.

A historical curiosity concerns a prophecy allegedly uttered by Joseph Smith:

> there will be a war between the northern states and the southern states beginning in South Carolina; the southern states 
>will call upon Great Britain for assistance; that after this, war will be "poured out on all nations"; and that "slaves 
>shall rise up against their masters, who shall be marshaled and disciplined for war".[^1]

Smith uttered this prophecy on December 25th, 1832--a strangely accurate statement although there are ways other than prophecy that one could have obtained such insights. Still, the specifics are fairly accurate. It seems likely that *something* was talking 
to Smith, although the identity of that something might well have not been what Smith thought it was. 

The something that Smith was allegedly talking to goes by two names--Nephi and Moroni. The second name seems to be a Greek language invention, but the first has its basis in Hebrew. Loosely translated, the Hebrew name means something like "temple servant". 
The status of the servant would be something akin to a dish washer. The name Moroni, however, from the Greek, would seem to have uncomfortable ties to the word "moron". Nephi is not without its own uncomfortable association as a shortened version of the 
word Nephilim. This presence, however, guided Smith into suggesting he had an important purpose to serve out and likewise indicated that it was once a human personage responsible for military combat of a defeated people. One wonders why this would not have 
been qualified more along the lines of being a ghost, but it appears Smith did not take it to be such. This presence explained that their people understood Hebrew but had written some gold plates in a languaged called "Reform Egyptian". Of note was that 
Nephi had been a military commander. 

Smith does not waste time in forming a militia which he marches to Missouri only to find that the locals do not care for him. Of note is that Mormonism begins with a strongly anti-masonic basis--or at least the literature tries to persuade one that this is 
so. The Morgan affair had recently occurred in which a Mason (Morgan) had attempted to publish a book about the rites of masonry and disappeared. This ignited an anti-masonic firestorm, which was the backdrop under which Mormonism was developing.  However, 
it is noted that Smith came from a Masonic family:

>The Joseph Smith family was known and acknowledged to have been a close knitted one, where strong individual affection and loyalty existed between each of the members. It was a Masonic family which lived by and practiced the estimable and admirable tenets 
>of Freemasonry. The father, Joseph Smith, Sr., was a documented member in upstate New York. He was raised to the degree of Master Mason on May 7, 1818 in Ontario Lodge No. 23 of Canandaigua, New York. An older son, Hyrum Smith, was a member of Mount Moriah 
>Lodge No. 112, Palmyra New York. Numerous attempts have been made to prove that Joseph Smith and his family where depraved, degenerate and disreputable persons. These documented facts, namely, the Masonic membership of Joseph Smith, Sr., in the Lodge in 
>Canandaigua, and Hyrum's membership in Palmyra Lodge, are of the most significant importance. Being the elite institution it was recognized by the public to be at that time, and their active membership in two of the Masonic lodges of the area is convincing 
>evidence of the stature and high esteem the members of the family enjoyed in the eyes and opinions of those who knew them best. As touched on previously, the founding of Mormonism or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, took place under the 
>strikingly peculiar circumstances associated with the turbulent, tenuous atmosphere then gripping west central and up-state New York. This community unrest was primarily due to the vicious anti-Masonic furor which was triggered by the controversial 
>disappearance of William Morgan. A booklet attributed to the vanished William Morgan appeared in Batavia, New York, in October of 1826 titled "Illustrations of Masonry," by one of the Fraternity who has devoted thirty years to the subject.[^2] 

 
So we can clearly see the masonic influence via the family, but what about the curious removal of Mormonism from Masonry or the attempt thereof?

>The Morgan booklet was extensively printed and distributed causing a torrential flood of publicity related to the practices and ceremonies of the craft. This booklet of lies, insinuations and half-truths was avidly and devouringly read by a people eager to 
>believe the worst about anything they did not understand especially a so-called "secret society." During this time Joseph Smith, Jr., received and recorded a series of visitations by the Angel Moroni, found and translated the golden plates into what is now 
>known as the Book of Mormon. During the third week of March 1830, the Book of Mormon was offered for sale at Palmyra, New York. Critics of The Book of Mormon quickly attempted to attribute the mentioning of secret societies in the volume to the influence of 
>the notorious publicity stemming from thee Morgan affair. A number of incidents are recounted in the Book of Mormon concerning secret societies and evil practices indulged in by this type organization. Understandably, but mistakenly, the general public 
>semantically considered Freemasonry to be the epitome of a secret society and consequently related Mormonism and Freemasonry at the same well spring. The inaccurate writings of numerous prejudiced and emotional authors helped to further confuse the issue. 
>Hundreds of pieces of literature began to appear very quickly with the common theme claiming that the contents of the recently translated Mormon scripture had been influenced by the Morgan excitement. The rise of sentiment for the anti-Masonic party and all 
>the publicity from stage presentations mocking the craft was further fueled by the public claims that Joseph Smith, Jr., had used Masonic work to produce the Book of Mormon. The public lumped them into the same basket and with the Masonic background of the 
>Smith's, Mormonism and Freemasonry became so interwoven in the public mind as to be one and the same.(ibid) 


So far, it all makes sense. Of course, things take a turn for the weird later when Mormonism and Masonry merge into roughly the same thing because of Morgan's wife:

>If the death of William Morgan was the fuel that sparked the great anti-Masonic movement then the actions of his wife was the breath that fanned the flames. This celebrated woman who, like Niobe, was all tears and affliction and whose hand was ever held 
>forth to receive contributions from the sympathetic Anti-Masons, who vowed eternal widowhood, pains and penance, remarried. On November 23, 1830, Lucindia Morgan married George W. Harris, a Mason and converted to Mormonism and moved to Nauvoo, 
>Illinois.(ibid) 

We will see later how this leads into mormonism becoming a false religion and how it affected Native Americans in Part 2.
