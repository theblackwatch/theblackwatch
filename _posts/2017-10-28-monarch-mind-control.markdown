In the old days, there was a bear Goddess in the regions of Gaul and France. This Bear Goddess was worshiped by Druids and Gauls--which later moved into Rome and Greece. In Greece the Bear Goddess became known as Diana or Artemis and took on Mercury overtones in Rome.

The women who tied to this Bear Goddess had a strong understanding of the mother and shamanism. They easily went into trances. These states were enabled further by people like the Druids, who encouraged this trance.

Naturally, these women were seen more akin to queens. The Druids also worshiped the sun in a Baal like way, so the queens in question where more like sun queens. 

As time moved on, people forgot about the Bear Goddess and Bear Men like Arthur--but the collective consciousness did not. On the state flag of California a bear named Monarch appeared not long before Hollywood began to make movies.

Since the Druids developed the Queens and human sacrifice to make themselves agriculturally and sometimes materially richer, it is little surprise that mind control evolved from these beginnings, although it would take a World War to make it happen.

Josef Mengele developed modern day mind control that was adopted by the CIA later in programs that were titled Mk-Ultra and not too surprisngly--Monarch. Mengele simply wanted to split the personality with enough trauma. Once that was done, those who could stand it would develop two personalities in a disassociated state--rather like the old Roman Goddess Janus or the fertility God Dionysus in the old Greek. This insanity could then be "activated" by the state at the appointed time.

After the War, Hollywood drew in women who wanted to be "stars". It pulled on their pride from former periods where their ancestors had been shaman queens with the ability to talk to the spirits. Instead, these women were used to affect the mass consciousness in vile ways, and often disposed of when they were no longer needed. This was the fruit of the mind control experiments--to have control over the minds of both men and women who were so disassociated that they could be activated by certain symbols or sounds just as a shamanic state is activated by the same. The "Gods" they would be speaking with, however, would only be what their wealthy and powerful "handlers" wanted them to speak with. 

In the modern world, this old archetype has been combined with new initiatives like gay rights and homosexual behavior. This is an attempt to de-normalize the typical family unit and mother which is the concrete of modern civilization. While it is true that same sex relationships proliferated anciently, there was still and understanding of the family unit. It appears all these sleeper agents are being awoken to serve this new agenda to disrupt and otherwise distort what must be to have order. Monarch programming was the result of Nazi conditioning which had little respect for life or the mother, and everything to do with power and control. 

Perhaps somewhat surprising is that the Celtic tribes were likely a lost Israel tribe of Dan or Levi or possibly both. [^1] When those tribes broke from Israel, they apparently fell into human sacrifice with little coaxing. It is not terribly ironic then, that Nazis who were virulently anti-Jewish fell easily into such traditions--particularly not with the nearby caves of France where such Bear Goddess worship proliferated. 

To break the conditioning, all that is needed is to relate to the mother again as the center of the family and the children as being something other than food for hungry sacrifice. Every other value system based upon this conditioning which unfortunately includes most television and video games is likely to be an abomination. Every man or woman who joins the military or trades her family for money or her friends for fame is serving Baal and is likely suffering from such conditioning. We have a duty to speak against it where we can, and to put an end to it in whatever manner we can.
