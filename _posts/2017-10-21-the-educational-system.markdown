It should come as not much of a surprise that those who have resources as a result of various occult practices should want to keep those resources for themselves and their families. To make this possible, it becomes necessary to control the flow of information, but especially systems that allow one to be in positions of power in society. It is self-evident then that one would need some manner of gate-keeper that has the appearance of being equal opportunity, but in reality has no such aim.

One would be hard-pressed to find a better candidate for this position than the educational system in the US. If education becomes expensive AND competitive, and the material taught has been tampered with to indoctrinate young minds into what society wants them to do or believe, then one has a system that both makes those who control it rich, AND allows them to educate those that have the proclivity to learn  to be "good citizens". In other words, by getting students to compete against one another and pay outrageously for the privilege to do so, one can teach them anything so long as the promise of money is behind the education. 

If you can further get the students into debt, then you have guaranteed indentured servitude. If the student fails to "make the cut" in the way the system is defined academically, then they will only have themselves to blame and will likely consider themselves to be flawed because they could not make the academic cut. Nevermind all the many spiritual gifts that are being mutilated or otherwise discouraged because those gifts threaten the status quo. 

In reality, the systems of Greece are what informed this particular style of education, and as we shall see in later analysis, Greece is a huge problem in that in presents rationality in a light that was superseded by later spiritual developments.
