If you have not read the previous post on Masonic Blood Oaths, I suggest you do so [here.](./_posts/2017-10-12-masonic-interference.markdown)

Once the throat is sufficiently locked by a blood oath, it is relatively trivial to institute Pagan sun Worship.

A Masonic Lodge facs the East, it is said, like a temple of Solomon. However, unlike a Temple of Solomon, there is no sun in the east but instead a person called the Master of the Lodge who administers everything. This is nothing but the old pagan sun king rituals of Norway, France, and elsewhere.

A Temple of Solomon worships neither the sun nor Solomon but YHVH and sees everything else as a representation of His kingdom. A pagan sun temple attempts to make a God of the sun itself, and all Masonic Lodges do this instead to men, which is a far graver matter.

It should be noted as well that the Temple of Solomon in Israel was destroyed presumably because God was displeased with it. Why then would there be a network of temples based upon it that are far less holy than it?

The answer is jarring--because by worshipping the sun such as the Baal worshippers did in the old testament, it can give people certain benefits because they are seen as mini-suns on the Earth. It is easy to think of this in terms of Hollywood. A Hollywood Star is someone who, as the name implies, shines brightly and so draws attention.

Of course, we all also know what happens to Hollywood Stars. They are train wrecks because their egos tend to get the best of them. In the old pagan rites, one instead becomes a sacrifice to the sun. Egypt and Greece have analogies to this practice, as well as some Native American religions.

Having an entire network of willing sacrifices allows those at the top of the Masonic pyramid an immense amount of  control through the ant colony it has administered. Each lodge does certain ritual, at regular intervals. Each member takes a series of blood oaths. They also take obligations to help one another as brothers. It is little surprise then that such a scenario makes it easy to repeat the sins of Cain while becoming materially wealthy. Who is at the top of such a long chain of reprehensible conduct? Who would dare to take the Bible and twist it in defiance of commandments? We shall speculate about that in another post.
