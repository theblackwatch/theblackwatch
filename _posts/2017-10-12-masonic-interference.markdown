If one dares to consider the world as a metaphysical entity as well as a physical entity, it is necessary to admit as a starting principle a certain
nefarious interloper--an outright hijacker and usurper within that realm that is as old as the Fallen Angels--indeed, it is the charitable organization referred to as the Masons. 

Most Masons are relatively harmless since the organization stacks in a familiar pattern--that of a pyramid. Those on the bottom are little more than drones that act as a variety of antennae for those at the top. Likewise, they are a handy source
of dues and keep the lodge functioning by quoting ritual that they know to be Biblical and so console themselves that the blood oath required to join is a mere formality that all Christians would have little to no compunction speaking. A great oversight is that the founder of Christianity strongly forbade oaths of any sort.
It is no surprise then that by adopting the same methods implemented by the fallen angels and cursing the voice with a blood oath from the line of Cain ought to be a matter of deep concern for anyone wishing to operate in the world in a manner
that is in keeping with what any society professing "Christian Values" should be doing.

> Again you have heard that it was said to the ancients, "Do not lie in your oath, but you will fulfill to THE LORD your oath." But I say to you, Do not swear at all, not by Heaven, for it is the throne of God. Neither by the earth, for it is his stool for his feet, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make in it a certain hair black or white. But your statement shall be, "Yes, yes" and, "No, no"; anything more than these is from The Evil One.  

Clearly, what is being outlined is a way to ensure one's speech is not cursed or dual. A necessity that prefaces doing evil can be seen in the actions of the Fallen Angels in apocrophal literature:

 >And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters.  
  
  >And the angels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: 'Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and beget us children.'  
  
  >And Shemikhazah, who was their leader, said unto them: 'I fear you will not indeed agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty of a great sin.'
  And they all answered him and said: 'Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by imprecations not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.'
  Then they all swore together and bound themselves by imprecations upon it.
  And they were in all two hundred; who descended in the days of Yared on the summit of Mount Hermon, and they called it Mount Hermon, because they had sworn and bound themselves by imprecations upon it.
  (1Enoch 6:1-6)
