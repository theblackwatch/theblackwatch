We all like to think that stopping hate is the motivation behind movements that proclaim to be about equality and tolerance. It sounds correct to our ears that groups 
that are the target of hate by others and intolerance should not be experiencing such things. However, there is a potential serious problem with those who play false 
victims in order to bully others into acceptance of a given agenda. Nowhere is this more present than within the gay-rights movements. Let us examine the roots of the 
movement historically to determine what fruits we can expect from it.

The first thing that should catch our attention is that a definition of any movement that follows from a purely sexual practice ought not in and of itself constitute 
an identity. Rather, such a variable is better delimited as a preference. For instance, we would not say that a woman who finds blond-haired men attractive is a 
blondist. Even if we did, it wouldn't make much sense to do this. The woman in question finds blond-haired men more attractive. Her judgment to the attraction is her 
*preference.* To label her identity as her preference is to mistake the cart for the horse. 

We all have multiple preferences. Some people like to live in the country. Some prefer cities. We do not, however, attempt to define those things as identities. One 
does not mistake an adjective for a noun. If one describes themselves as a tall woman, we do not mistake the word tall for an identity. Rather, it describes something 
that is characteristic *of* her identity of which the noun woman is a subset. In other words, even the noun woman does not encompass the entirety of her identity. It 
is merely a crucial piece--the lens which shapes her observations of which biology is an essential and strong driver.

So, before we even begin an historical evaluation, we find that the language has been manipulated to make it do something which flows against English grammar as well 
as common sense. This is a dead-giveway some sleight-of-hand is at work. 

The World Wars saw a gradual societal change when it came to matters of homosexuality. Why should a war be cause for such a change--or a catalyst? In part because war 
upsets the normal social order of civilization. Many soldiers returned after serving their countries who were homosexual and on the basis of their military service 
they demanded equal rights. Is military service, despite the fact society deems it a social good, a valid platform for suggesting such changes? If such a matter were 
about love, it would seem that war would not be the natural catalyst for change. Consider the civil rights "peaceful protests" as a counter-example. Sit-ins and 
non-violence were the principles on which that movement rested. Being a military veteran and "demanding" rights seems to be another version of war.

It was not until Hoover, however, that the gay-rights movement would gain what it really required to take off--the right back-drop. 

>It is difficult to recall in our era of celebrating gay rights that once upon a time homosexuals were considered as much a security risk as Communist spies. The case 
of Whittaker Chambers, the chief witness against his fellow spy Alger Hiss, illustrated that era’s deep assumption of an overlap between spying and homosexuality. In a 
confession to carefully selected FBI men, Chambers admitted to homosexual cruising while committing espionage for the Soviets. Many suspected this already, with 
several newspapermen, many of whom originally supported Hiss but saw evidence mount that he knew Chambers, believing that they were lovers. Richard Nixon, in many ways 
the man who, as a California congressman, “got” Hiss, later told his White House inner circle that Hiss and Chambers were lovers; when he brought them together into 
the same hotel room, he recalled, Hiss demanded to see Chambers’s dental work in order to ascertain whether he knew him. This indicated, Nixon concluded, that they had 
engaged in oral sex together.

>Given the homophobia in the culture of the day, the parallels between the spy and the homosexual should not be surprising. Both used “signals,” met in alleys and 
obscure hotel rooms, lied under oath to protect their secret lives, and were vulnerable to prosecution if they didn’t “name” others.[^1]


So we can see clearly that the spectre of war again raises the matter of gay rights--this time having to do with spying. Hoover himself was likely gay--and he clearly 
was a spy. In the interests of keeping secrets, a person who was homosexual was better advised to hide such a thing because such a value was considered deviant in 
society. However, someone who was deviant made an excellet spy, because spys must also keep secrets. If their sexuality is fluid as well, then it allows them greater 
powers of seduction. In the end, it comes down to old archetypes concering those old Gods who were mercurial such as Hermes or Odin. These Gods could appear to be 
women and would perform sexual acts with either sex as an expression of their androgyny. This made them, of course, excellent spies. It also made them morally 
unscrupulous and untrustworthy. So rather than Hoover being some bigoted fascist, it may simply have been a case of it takes a gay-spy to realize the need to carefully 
examine gay people to insure they are not, in fact, spies. This, of course, is no excuse to be cruel to a group of people, but it is also not the case the the story of 
homosexual history is not without a dark under current that is not often examined.

Our above source concludes: 

>Charles’s book is an excellent example of how to write about a dark chapter in the Bureau’s past without venting. The author is remarkably objective about a time when 
a prude, and possible hypocrite, lumped gays in with authentic traitors. In Hoover’s warped view, “deviates” destroyed society’s moral foundations and were therefore 
as destructive as Americans who bolstered the Soviets’ nuclear capability.

It is interesting to note the judgment on Hoover's values in the above article. What then is the modern aim of the homosexual movement?

>Sociologist Mary Bernstein writes: "For the lesbian and gay movement, then, cultural goals include (but are not limited to) challenging dominant constructions of 
masculinity and femininity, homophobia, and the primacy of the gendered heterosexual nuclear family (heteronormativity). Political goals include changing laws and 
policies in order to gain new rights, benefits, and protections from harm."[7] Bernstein emphasizes that activists seek both types of goals in both the civil and 
political spheres.[^2]

So pretty much, it seems by their own admisison that Hoover's characterization in the above article is correct--although that does not necessarily mean they are also 
spies. Hoover felt there was something subversive about those of that identity, and it would appear he was right.

What is the modern foundation of the gay movement?



>The crime syndicate saw profit in catering to shunned gay clientele, and by the mid-1960s, the Genovese crime family controlled most Greenwich Village gay bars. In 
1966, they purchased Stonewall Inn (a “straight” bar and restaurant), cheaply renovated it, and reopened it the next year as a gay bar.
>
>Stonewall Inn was registered as a type of private “bottle bar,” which did not require a liquor license because patrons were supposed to bring their own liquor. Club 
attendees had to sign their names in a book upon entry to maintain the club’s false exclusivity. The Genovese family bribed New York’s Sixth Police Precinct to ignore 
the activities occurring within the club.
>
>Without police interference, the crime family could cut costs how they saw fit: The club lacked a fire exit, running water behind the bar to wash glasses, clean 
toilets that didn’t routinely overflow, and palatable drinks that weren’t watered down beyond recognition. What’s more, the Mafia reportedly blackmailed the club’s 
wealthier patrons who wanted to keep their sexuality a secret.
>
>Nonetheless, Stonewall Inn quickly became an important Greenwich Village institution. It was large and relatively cheap to enter. It welcomed drag queens, who 
received 
a bitter reception at other gay bars and clubs. It was a nightly home for many runaways and homeless gay youths, who panhandled or shoplifted to afford the entry fee. 
And it was one of the few—if not the only—gay bar left that allowed dancing.
>
>Raids were still a fact of life, but usually corrupt cops would tip off Mafia-run bars before they occurred, allowing owners to stash the alcohol (sold without a 
liquor license) and hide other illegal activities. In fact, the NYPD had stormed Stonewall Inn just a few days before the riot-inducing raid.
The Stonewall Riots Begin
>
>When police raided Stonewall Inn on the morning of June 28, it came as a surprise—the bar wasn’t tipped off this time.
>
>Armed with a warrant, police officers entered the club, roughed up patrons, and, finding bootlegged alcohol, arrested 13 people, including employees and people 
violating the state’s gender-appropriate clothing statute (female officers would take suspected cross-dressing patrons into the bathroom to check their sex).
>
>Fed up with constant police harassment and social discrimination, angry patrons and neighborhood residents hung around outside of the bar rather than disperse, 
becoming increasingly agitated as the events unfolded and people were aggressively manhandled. At one point, an officer hit a lesbian over the head as he forced her 
into the paddy wagon — she shouted to onlookers to act, inciting the crowd to begin throw pennies, bottles, cobble stones, and other objects at the police.
>
>Within minutes, a full-blown riot involving hundreds of people began. The police, a few prisoners, and a Village Voice writer barricaded themselves in the bar, which 
the mob attempted to set on fire after breaching the barricade repeatedly.
>
>The fire department and a riot squad were eventually able to douse the flames, rescue those inside Stonewall, and disperse the crowd. But the protests, sometimes 
involving thousands of people, continued in the area for five more days, flaring up at one point after the Village Voice published its account of the riots.
>
>Though the Stonewall uprising didn’t start the gay rights movement, it was a galvanizing force for LGBT political activism, leading to numerous gay rights 
organizations, including the Gay Liberation Front, Human Rights Campaign, GLAAD (formerly Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation), and PFLAG (formerly Parents, 
Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays).
>
>In 2016, President Barack Obama designated the site of the riots—Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park, and the surrounding streets and sidewalks—a national monument in 
recognition of the area’s contribution to gay and human rights.[^3]
 
So organized crime and nearly killing law enforcement are the foundations. At the roots of the modern movement are some very serious, dark under-currents.These matters 
do not sound like love--or the recognitition of love. Certainly, any oppressed people will, sooner or later, rise up. However, in the above scenarios, War seems to be the major 
catalyst. We can say then that if war is a form of fire, that these events are using fire to steadily advance an agenda that dresses itself up to be something it 
isn't. Like the wine God of old--Dionysus--the mask drops and we find that what is really driving the history of the movement is a militarism and propensity toward 
violence. We could easily swap gay rights in the above scenario with "terrorist group" and we likely would not notice the difference. Why then is this movement not 
called out for this? We shall address that in a future article.
